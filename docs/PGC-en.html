<p>
   After the development of this project, a Computer Science Graduation Project was made as a partial requirement to obtain the title of Bachelor of Computer Science following this same line of research. It is with great pleasure that we make the full document available free of charge after the defense. The document can be downloaded <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.docs_folder }}Algoritmos_Evolutivos_para_Regressao_Simbolica_utilizando_a_estrutura_Interacao-Transformacao.pdf"> by this link (portuguese)</a>.

   The slide show used in the defense is also available <a href="https://galdeia.github.io/presentations/PGC.pdf"> here</a>, and can be viewed on this page as well (portuguese).
